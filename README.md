# Simplecast
Dead-simple tool to cast files to a chromecast device

Developers:
- [craig-chasseur](https://github.com/craig-chasseur/) original author
- [busterbeam](https://github.com/busterbeam/) added finer control and removed server prompts

It depends on pychromecast and allows for terminal based interactive control of media playback.  Or non interactive playback, with a one command start and ignore.
